 * React Global Setup (Guest Runtime)

 * - Guest bundles that reference globals (externalized builds)
 * - Engine.require('react' | 'react/jsx-runtime') resolution
 *
 * NOTE: This module must run before rill/sdk is evaluated, because
 * rill/sdk defines some exports (e.g., ErrorBoundary) at module init time.
